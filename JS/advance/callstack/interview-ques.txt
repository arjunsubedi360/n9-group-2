1. **What is JavaScript?**
   - JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It enables interactive web pages and is supported by all modern web browsers.

2. **What are the different data types in JavaScript?**
   - JavaScript has primitive data types like numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, as well as complex data types like objects and arrays.

3. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` operators?**
   - `==` is an equality operator that performs type coercion, while `===` is a strict equality operator that requires both value and type to be the same for equality.

4. **What is the `typeof` operator used for in JavaScript?**
   - `typeof` is a unary operator that returns a string indicating the type of the operand.

5. **Explain `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript.**
   - `var` is function-scoped, `let` is block-scoped and allows reassignment, and `const` is block-scoped but does not allow reassignment once declared.

6. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
   - Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

7. **What is closure in JavaScript?**
   - A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

8. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**
   - Event delegation is a technique for managing event handlers on a parent element, rather than attaching them directly to child elements.

9. **Explain the concept of callback functions.**
   - Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions, to be executed later. They are commonly used in asynchronous programming, such as event handling or AJAX requests.

10. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**
    - `null` represents the intentional absence of any object value, while `undefined` indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

11. **How do you handle errors in JavaScript?**
    - Errors in JavaScript can be handled using `try...catch` blocks, where code that might throw an error is placed within a `try` block and any errors are caught and handled in the `catch` block.

12. **What are arrow functions in JavaScript?**
    - Arrow functions are a more concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript, with a syntax that allows for implicit return and lexical `this` binding.

13. **Explain the concept of promises in JavaScript.**
    - Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable way than callbacks.

14. **What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**
    - The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: in a method, `this` refers to the owner object; in a function, `this` refers to the global object (in non-strict mode) or `undefined` (in strict mode).

15. **How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?**
    - JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has a prototype object from which it inherits properties.
