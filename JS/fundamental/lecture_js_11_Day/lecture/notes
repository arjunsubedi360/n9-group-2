The `for-in` loop and `for-of` loop are both loop constructs in JavaScript, but they are used for different purposes and have some key differences:

1. **Iterating over properties vs. values**: The `for-in` loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object, while the `for-of` loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object, such as an array or a string.

2. **Order of iteration**: The `for-in` loop does not guarantee any specific order of iteration, as the order of object properties is not guaranteed in JavaScript. On the other hand, the `for-of` loop iterates over the values in the order they appear in the iterable object.

3. **Iterables vs. Objects**: The `for-of` loop can only be used with iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, and other built-in iterables or custom objects that implement the iterable protocol. On the other hand, the `for-in` loop can be used to iterate over the enumerable properties of any object, including built-in objects and custom objects.

4. **Accessing values vs. accessing keys**: In a `for-in` loop, the loop variable represents the property key, which can be used to access the corresponding value of the object using bracket notation or dot notation. In a `for-of` loop, the loop variable represents the actual value of the iterable object, and there is no need to access the keys separately.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between `for-in` and `for-of` loops:

```javascript
const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};

// Using for-in loop to iterate over object properties
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(key); // Output: "a", "b", "c"
  console.log(obj[key]); // Output: 1, 2, 3
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3];

// Using for-of loop to iterate over array values
for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value); // Output: 1, 2, 3
}
```

In summary, the `for-in` loop is used to iterate over object properties, while the `for-of` loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object, such as an array. The `for-of` loop is generally preferred when iterating over arrays or other iterable objects, while the `for-in` loop is used for iterating over object properties.
